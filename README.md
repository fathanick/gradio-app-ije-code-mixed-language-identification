# Indonesian-Javanese-English Code-Mixed Language Identification with Gradio

Welcome to the "Indonesian-Javanese-English Code-Mixed Language Identification" repository! This project is designed to tackle the fascinating challenge of identifying code-mixed language instances within text that seamlessly combines Indonesian, Javanese, and English languages.

## Key Features:

1. Multiple Models: Our repository provides three distinct models for code-mixed language identification:
   a. Traditional Machine Learning: Utilizing classic machine learning techniques to identify code-mixed segments.
   b. Deep Learning: Employing deep neural networks to enhance language identification accuracy.
   c. Transformer-Based Fine-Tuning: Fine-tuning state-of-the-art transformer models to excel in code-mixed language recognition.

2. Gradio Interface: We've integrated Gradio, a user-friendly and interactive interface, allowing you to easily test and deploy these models. Experience firsthand how these models perform on real-world code-mixed language data.

3. Multilingual Support: Our models are optimized to handle code-mixing involving Indonesian, Javanese, and English languages, making them versatile for various language scenarios.

4. Research and Experimentation: This repository serves as a valuable resource for researchers and language enthusiasts interested in code-mixed language analysis. Feel free to explore our code, experiment with the models, and contribute to ongoing research in this field.
